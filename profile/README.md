# Articuno

The official organization for Articuno bot on [Discord](https://discord.com/).

----

Hello there. We are the official organization for the development of Articuno bot, a Discord bot that can do a number of jobs for different servers since 2020 Feburary. Our goal is very simple and straight forward. We do our best to bring a better quality throughout years to the bot. Thank you for choosing Articuno as part of your server.

Official site: [https://blue.is-a.dev/Articuno](https://blue.is-a.dev/Articuno)

# Getting started

Source code of the bot is in the [Articuno](https://github.com/Articuno-org/Articuno) repository. Do notice that this is just a part of the bot code, not a full one since it remains private. I do try my best to determine what should be set to public and what is private. My goal is 75% of the bot code should be set to public.

Further more, other repositories are for random stuff during our development work. Feel free to check them if you like.

# Contribution

Articuno is being developed with the [interactions.py](https://github.com/interactions-py/library) Python library, an easy, simple, scalable and modular Python API wrapper for interactions.

Pull Requests are welcomed.
